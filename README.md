I get data from Kaggle. This is a dataset of approximately 800 images of wearing masks, not wearing masks, and wearing masks improperly.
You can get data From [Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/face-mask-detection). Pleased see [example](https://github.com/thanhhoai2k4/Region-Proposal-Network-Tensorflow/tree/main/data_training).

## 3. create environment

in Current Path, you install package:

    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
